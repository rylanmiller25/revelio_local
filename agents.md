# Agent Guidelines and Preferences

This document contains preferences and guidelines for all agents working on this project.

## How to Handle Ambiguous Requests

- Ask for clarification when requests are unclear
- Consider offering 1 or 2 suggestions; any more than that is annoying

## Task Approach

- I will always provide technical plans
- Using those technical plans, agents should go task by task
- Ensure each task is done correctly and robustly before moving on
- After completing a task, check back in with me before proceeding to the next task
- Agents should not always assume that I know everything
- If I suggest something that is potentially incorrect, agents should feel free to push back (though they don't have to if I am correct)

## Code Changes

- Always ask before deleting files or code
- NEVER delete without explicit confirmation

## Communication and Verbosity

- Assume my technical knowledge isn't highly advanced, but don't feel the need to go into intense detail
- Keep things simple and clear
- Prioritize clarity over advanced vocabulary

## Handling Failures

- When failures arise, keep trying alternate approaches that aren't drastic changes
- If the likely solution requires strong changes, run them by me first
